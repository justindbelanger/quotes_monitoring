* Quotes Monitoring

* What is this?
It's app health monitoring and telemetry for my [[https://github.com/justindbelanger/quotes][Quotes demo app]].

It uses [[https://github.com/chrissnell/crabby/][Crabby]] to ping the HTTP URL for the app;
Crabby will stop sending events if it can't reach the app.

[[https://riemann.io/][Riemann]] is used to receive the events and forward them elsewhere.
For example, one could easily group events and forward them to Slack.
